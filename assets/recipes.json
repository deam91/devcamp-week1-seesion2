Brown the meat and using the wooden spoon break it apart. Continue sauting until the sausage is cooked all the way through.Immediately add the green onion and chard leaves. Allow to steam for about 30 seconds before pouring the scrambled egg mixture evenly over the meat and veggies. This is where the technique comes in. Avoid the temptation to stir. Simply allow the skillet to sit 2 to three minutes. Then, using a wooden spoon or spatula, begin flipping sections of egg and veggies (similar to how you would fold whipped egg whites into a cake batter, just gently fold the scramble onto itself). Once all sections have been flipped over, everything to sit and cook another 2 or 3 minutes. Repeat the flipping.  Continue doing this until the egg is no longer cooking to the skillet.",
